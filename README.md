### About the game
In this platformer, you play as a llama who has been cursed with the inability to jump. Instead, you have to run around collecting balls of yarn, then toss the yarn to create ropes connecting one platform to another. There is a flag waiting for you somewhere in each level, which will then transport you to the next level. Good luck, and try not to run out of yarn or fall to your doom!

This game was created by Zlata B. and Jenny J.H. during the [Code Liberation Game Jam](http://codeliberation.org/events/event/code-liberation-game-jam/), which took place over a weekend in September 2013. Here are some [photos and videos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixperry/sets/72157636034466905) from the event, as well as [news coverage](http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/women-create-video-games-at-nyu-polytechnic-institute-1.6170525).
